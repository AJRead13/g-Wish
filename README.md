# G-WISH

## Description

This is a collaborative full-stack web application that combines a robust back-end with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication—-to an intuitive front end. It was created from scratch and is deployed using Heroku. This application gives users the opportunity to create a list of video games pulling data from the RawG api. Other users can comment on the posted game lists sharing their thoughts and creating a community experience.
